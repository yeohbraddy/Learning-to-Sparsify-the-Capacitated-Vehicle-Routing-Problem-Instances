  <h4>
    New Business:
  </h4>
  <p></p><b><u>Paper review:</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Start from general to specific
    </li>
    <li>
        1. ML for DSA design (refer to MIT module)
    </li>
    <li>
        2. ML for CO (cite some survey papers)
    </li>
    <li>
        3. How CO are solved in general (cite book since it is an old research area)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Linear Programming
            </li>
            <li>
                Integer Programming
            </li>
            <li>
                Mention Gurobi
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        4. ML for VRP
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mostly DL models
            </li>
            <li>
                Now we want to try classification, can cite Deepak's pruning paper to use similar technique
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Data consideration (cite dimac's dataset)
    </li>
    <li>
        How I exactly model it in Gurobi - there are different ways to model VRP in integer programming
    </li>
    <li>
        Put in introduction the constraints and what I am trying to optimize in the VRP problem
    </li>
  </ul>

  <b><u>Sem two report:</u></b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Leave two weeks or more for writing
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear, coherent and understandable to the general computer scientist
    </li>
    <li>
      Clarity in the writing dragged the grade down in previous projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Leave two weeks for contingency
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p></p><b><u>Braddy's questions:</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I can change the title and specification that is different to the proposal
    </li>
    <li>
      After pruning / using ML, in Gurobi, the corresponding variables will be zero
    </li>
    <li>
      Model does not matter as they all have similar accuracy. We want to minimize false negatives here as we want to get rid of the zeros with high confidence.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p></p><b><u>From Deepak:</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Think carefully how to get data in an ethical way for restaurants
    </li>
    <li>
      Will not lose marks if I drop restaurant dataset
    </li>
    <li>
      Full time masters is better
    </li>
  </ul>
